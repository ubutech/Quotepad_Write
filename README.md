Quotepad_Write
==============

C#-written application for Tablet-PC's and Whiteboard in the Windows environment.
The aim is to create an easy-to-use application for devices with touchscreen, beamers or anything else.

With my education as biochemist I noticed that expensive and dificult-to-use drawing applications for structure formulas
are just a giant pain in the ass. That's the core of this application: A simple drawing app for scientific use. 
So in begin 2009 I began development of this application, but with a growing schedule I had little time to finish it.
Eventually I have enjoyed working on and with this application, but maybe you guys can make it in something big ;)

Quotepad Write requires a Windows system preferable Windows 7. The use of Microsoft.Ink libraries, which are introduced
in Windows Vista, have not been fully tested on earlier editions as Windows XP. First tests showed siqnificantly poor results.
All coding is done in Visual Studio 2008 and 2010.
